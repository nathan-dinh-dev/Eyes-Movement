# Eyes-Movement
MIT xPro Coding Exercise - Eyes Movement

In JavaScript, events are actions that happen on a web page. They can be anything from a mouse moving to a user typing in some text. Events happen to most elements on the DOM. These events are a good way to bind a code to user actions. For example, consider a web page that has a form with a “Submit” button. We can bind the mouse button click to that button and submit the form data upon that click.

Mouse events are a popular way to bind the DOM elements to events. Some of these events are as follows:

* **click:** Triggered when the mouse is clicked
* **mousemove:** Triggered when the mouse moves over an element
* **mouseleave:** Triggered when mouse the leaves an element

The mouse movement event is used to update the position of the “eye” element displayed on the page.

This exercise is about to create a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement. This coding activity is required to bring together skills in JavaScript and CSS to create this dynamic experience.
